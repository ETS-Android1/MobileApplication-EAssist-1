## Description
This is an app to help the elderly use their Android mobile phone. 
Our solution uses the built in applications of the Android OS and itegrates some of their functionality within the app, 
this way the elderly can use our app to use every single necessary application within their Android phone. Our app is built to facilitate the usage of an 
Android phone and make it convenient to use. 

## Skills Learned
Throughout this project we learned to work collaboratively and to use the SCRUM process. 
We used SCRUM throughout this project and it taught us to use valuable skills. 
The team had to meet every week to discuss the progress that was being done and what was done, 
in these meetings we had to reflect on what we had done the day before. At the end of the sprint we had to reflect on what we had done throughout the week, 
such as our strengths, weaknesses, and things we had to work on. Through the use of SCRUM we learned organization, discipline, working collaboratively, responsability. 
Through this project we also learned how to work with Miro and Github to share our progress with the team and to keep track of the project itself.

## Special Notes for Michael
We would like to apologize for the vast amount of branches that were in this repo. We had a disagreement at the beginning on how to work with git properly and
we ended up doing so incorrectly. In each of our branches were the work we had done and our own commits. 
By the time we had realized our mistake it was too late to fix as it would appear that only one member had done any work. We have learned how to use git and github effectively
and in the future will not be commiting the same mistakes. I would like to state that the final work present in the main branch 
is thanks in part to all of us on the team and the commits do not accurately reflect the amount of work done by each team memeber. 
If you want to assess each of our contributions to the project please check each of our branches and check the commit history. 

Once again we would like to apologize for the error and thank you for understanding.
